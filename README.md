# static-website-with-vuejs
A static website example with Vue.js

## description
I used Vue.js for frontend. Backend was mocked with [JSON](src/moch/database.json) file. 

## my personal goals
- practicing && increasing CSS knowledge
- applying Vue.js knowledge. Especially the data transferring and creating components.

## TODOs
- filtering && displaying articles with keywords and categories(Science, Music, Art etc.)
- writing tests
- attaching backend service for retrieving data from a source(webscraping or API service)
- admin panel for adding new articles and analytical datas(clicks, geographical info, time spent etc.)
